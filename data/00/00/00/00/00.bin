  |   Grandia and Grandia 2, a pair of games originally released on         |
  |   Sega's Saturn and Dreamcast consoles, respectively, are coming to     |
  |   Nintendo Switch. Both games feature newly retouched details for the   |
  |   user interface, sprites, and textures, enhanced cinematics,           |
  |   Japanese and English audio tracks, and Japanese and English           |
  |   language support along with new French and German translations.       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Languages: English, French, German and Japanese.                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Notes: Update v1.00.26 (v65536) is included - Firmware: 8.1.0,        |
  |   Master Key 7.0.                                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   READ NFO Notes: During our tests, we noticed that some NSPs           |
  |   installers (like the built in SXOS Installer) might not work and      |
  |   will fail to install this game, even though it seems to be installed  |
  |   properly and integrity checks pass. We think some installers          |
  |   don't register metadata infos properly and cause the game to crash    |
  |   while booting Grandia 1 or Grandia 2 (game will crash and exit to     |
  |   the dashboard).                                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Have in mind this is also valid with the update, and you can't even   |
  |   boot the game at all, it will instantly crash with the error          |
  |   "the game cannot be started".                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Fortunately, not all installers are affected by this issue and old    |
  |   Tinfoil (the old build by Adubbz, with the basic UI like a DOS        |
  |   program) works fine with it.                                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Have in mind that old Tinfoil only installs NSP from network install  |
  |   or USB install, and not from SDCARD. Most likely, other installers    |
  |   like Devmenu will work but we didn't test them all. Both games also   |
  |   have been tested on SXOS 2.8 (both with and without the update).      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Enjoy!                                                                |
